go to tq.mit.edu/pcbmilling

install gestalt (python setup.py install)

install gsArduino library for arduino

compile and download to arduino triStepShield.ino

run virtual machine magicmill.py with 096-001a_boot.py in the same directory

you should be able to now go to tq.mit.edu/pcbmilling and jog around the machine

OR you can import magicmill as a python module and then call methods directly on it.
