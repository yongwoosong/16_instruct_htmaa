How can you rapidly prototype new computer controlled tools? Modularity and reusability enable rapid iteration in software. By incorporating these principles into machine kinematics, sensors/acutator interfaces, motion control, machine interfaces, and CAD/CAM software, we can make designing, building, and controlling new machines accessible to non-experts. Using digital fabrication tools, we can then easily make a whole new range of machines that make.
