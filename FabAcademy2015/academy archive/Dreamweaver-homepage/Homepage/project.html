Another problem was that the back of the part was moving. What I mean is the back part where the two bearings are holding the force the stepper motors are giving it to the bearings are so strong that I just bent the wood of the side-frame. This problem leads to the problem which the bearings don&rsquo;t get fixed and the tension of the ropes are not stable. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s when I quickly designed the frame for back positioning. It&rsquo;s made for a purpose of holding the side frame with reliable distance and to fix the double bearings steady.</p>

Problems were that my frame wasn&rsquo;t steady and that makes this project to be unreliable. He looked around the frame and suggested me the new mechanism of h-gantry which has the big difference of using only one set of string and obviously two less bearings to be used in the project. the mechanism is &nbsp;very easy to follow. It&rsquo;s because I have already struggled a lot with the CORE X-Y mechanism. </p>

The water pump only has input and output electric routes until I make connection with relay to connect with the Fabduino. Before putting it to real-use, I tested with the power supply to check if it actually works. What I learned is that relay is only a switch, I can think of it as very simple connection. To be honest, this is my first time actually cutting the wire of mass-product and modifying it for my own custom-use. By looking at the dat-sheet I noticed there are sets of output and input. For output I connect the power plug from and screw it down to make sure the electricity flows and for input looking at the icon of + and - I've managed to connect the extend wire to connect with fabduino.</p>

Because I tried the two mechanism which is h-gantry and core-xy I can develop more to make fancier. Obviously I still need to have fundamental problem to solve It's fixing the frame of upper part. I thought very lightly that I could do with the very soft material such as ropes and pliywood for making the frame of an moving elctronic product. What I haven't thought was came to my skin and gained as a experience that I will never ever forget. By the time passes I know more material and more handy craft work, of course the digital fabrication tool is the most part I have been improved. What I need to do for the next step making the frame that is only has the purpose of being as a frame. Fixing the mechanism that I can do easily now with time. I think with further approcach to arduino programming I can do more things.</p>
                                  <br>
                                  
                                  <h2 dir="ltr">WHAT HAVE I LEARNT </h2>
                                  
                                  <p dir="ltr"> Basically understanding what kind of thing is digital and analog and all the basic electronic theory is what I have learnt so far, and it won&rsquo;t be stopped until I stop making stuff (which means I&rsquo;ll keep learn about electronic theory continuously) </p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p dir="ltr">Just as I started assembling the parts after I printed out all the results I faced a lot of different problem to be solved. Tolerance was just a beginning. Not intending to see the way how the production going was very hard. &nbsp;I was able to use 3D printed parts but still needed lots of adjustment and making more adhesive material to make it steady. </p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p dir="ltr"> Now, &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t hesitate to &nbsp;use the 3D modeling tool to make something like the piece to hang the object or making it quickly to fix the tolerance problem </p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p dir="ltr">Stepper motor is strong but in the same way, there must be some environment (what i mean by machine parts) to be in perfect position(locked!!) position otherwise the tension doesn&rsquo;t make the machine to move. This is when I learnt that even I don&rsquo;t like screws sometimes the adhesive chemical compound will not be standing the force the motr drives.</p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p dir="ltr"> I&rsquo;ve got a lot to tell with Arduino coding. Since I&rsquo;m not very familiar with computer programming I was quite afraid of what to do. However, one of the good thing &nbsp;I learned was that by looking at some reference and plus asking for tips with instructors really helped me a lot when approaching new stuff. I haven&rsquo;t fully understand the coding but still I like to make it happen. and implement lots of different things in other project as well. </p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p dir="ltr"> Timeline and giving some time to finish the thing was important. Sometimes its hard to document as i go along, and sometimes there are some easy tool to maintain what I have done and learned so far. My lesson was that there are no shortcuts &nbsp;and I have to keep up the steady pace when doing the long projects. </p>
