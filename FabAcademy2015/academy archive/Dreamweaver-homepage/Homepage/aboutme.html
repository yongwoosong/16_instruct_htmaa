		  <h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>  
          <p>
												Fab academy is something that i'm learning hard to know something that can be learned but kept my mind from 
                                                whether i can do this or noã……. As a matter of fact i want to learn every single detail that is related to 
                                                digital-fabrication in order to do further with building something new that could be funny or stupid but to 
                                                me is one of the marvelous project that i've ever done.		
          </p>
		  <p>
												I've always got interested in everty kind of knowleges such as music, art, technology and SW etc. For me 
                                                learning something new is always entertaining. I don't have any future plans what i would exactly be doing 
                                                after 10 years, however i know that i'll be still learning to do something for the next step.

								<h2 class="major"><span>What's your future goal?</span></h2>
								<p>
								Like everybody else, I love to create something new and try something that i can make people smile. Recently, I began to 				listen to the lecture about making the products. From University lecture i found that our society is changing and something similar to Industrial revolution might occur in short time.

Big Data, Internet of Things, 3D Printers are associating with each others and will be our future. There are many ways to contribute to our society. My goal as a student is learning these trends fast enough to catch the rapid running future tide. Maybe i can create something new but what if i don't follow trends. Important thing is i am learning something new and enjoying it.
