                                          <p dir="ltr">Reason why I&rsquo;m trying to build this thing is because I get to control in all directions. like 3D printer. Obviously when i need a lot of work done with controlling the stepper motor</p>
                                          <p dir="ltr">My main goal is to make machine move around in 3-axes. In return, I get to make some fun stuff to people around me as well. I'm still not sure how this things going to work so I've found some references of past fab academy studen'ts work. By the looks of it I have to some implementation of CORE-XY or H Gantry motion which I learned from close friends of mine. He had a past experience of making 3D printers so I learned a lot from him. There will be layers obstacles standing on the board with different design to give players difficulties about moving from start to the end. when players can move from one space to the other and make it safe to the final goal will be the winner. </p>
 										  <p dir="ltr">As a matter of fact, I tend to re-use the thing i built from CNC project. </p>
 										  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
 										  <p dir="ltr">(UPDATE : I got contact with a guy who made 3D printer before, after the final project presentation) </p>
 										  <p dir="ltr">I learned from my countless failures that for my idea I need 'stablized' frame to move objects from one place to the other. Even though I had bearings for smooth movement the smoothness must be applied in every directions. Using core-xy is also a good idea but h gantry like shown has less bearings to be used and It works very similar with core-xy movement. The main point is both movement requires two stepper motors so I think fixing the frame first and then moving the motors must be done. My	helper	also	gave	me	some	idea	fixing the frame by making laser-cut sheet which has holes to fix components.</p>
