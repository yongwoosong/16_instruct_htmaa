                                        <section>
                                          <h1 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-eb19344c-d8b8-155b-d5e3-9ad3cf9dfa4e">INVENTION</h1>
                                          <p dir="ltr"> This project is got a secret behind it. It looks like a gardening device but behind it is the core machine. When you see above is what we call 3D Printer, CNC router PCB all these kind of things are inside here. </p>
                                          <p dir="ltr"> I see this device as an easy way to distribute movement device to everyone. It&rsquo;s widely used in many industrial area and I don&rsquo;t have to say them one by one. If there are more knowledge to be accumulated normal people like me can have access to this device. Reason is even i made it with effort and now I&rsquo;m giving this effort to everyone who are interested. It&rsquo;s a machine &nbsp;that has a beauty of controlling in one position to other position.</p>
                                          <h1 dir="ltr">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h1>
                                          <p dir="ltr"> This project is freely opened to anyone who is interested. It&rsquo;s even changeable as I get to distribute 3D modeled file drawn in Sketchup. As far as i know the sketchup are the tools that has many plugins and therefore has lots of variety. This model is distributed so </p>
                                          <h1 dir="ltr">INCOME</h1>
                                          <p dir="ltr"> Just as similar with arduino and ubuntu donation is always welcome.</p>
                                          <h1 dir="ltr">COMPANY</h1>
                                          <p dir="ltr"> I do not believe certain &nbsp;investors will be paying a lot of money to establish a company but however, I know that certain fellow dreamers might be interested in making another machine with additional axes and do more things with robotics. </p>
                                          <h1 dir="ltr">FUNDING</h1>
                                          <p dir="ltr">Crowd-funding like on Kickstarter and Indie-gogo may be an good option but there are certain aspects and marketing strategy that I must know before launching, otherwise my idea will sink it with very low interest. &nbsp;As i mentioned earlier, sometimes open-source can be very stabilized once it&rsquo;s easy to use and get access </p>
                                          <h1 dir="ltr">WHAT I LEARNED</h1>
                                          <p dir="ltr"> I rethink my project as what I wanted to become. I wanted to be a maker and being aside of it I see lots of legal issues and economic problem that I must think carefully thorough. I know from working as an non-profit organization to help hardware startups I see lots of problem other than developing their software. </p>
