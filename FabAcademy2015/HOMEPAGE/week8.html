I've measured from left-up corner starting from 90 and increasing the count by 10. The mill which looks awful was the only one that i could use that had 2 leaves and burnt so in fact It was good approach to use the end-mill that is not in 100% state.</p>

                                         <p dir="ltr">I did some testing before cutting the plywood (12T), to find appropriate chip-load for the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our inventory(FabLab Seoul) was running out of end-mills due to regular comers and &nbsp;overuse of end-mills. So before cutting the actual wooden part it was necessary to do test.</p>
                                         <p dir="ltr"> It was quite sorry for myself that i didn&rsquo;t find scrap piece of wooden material for tolerance test, which could have been wasting material for nothing. Because i had quite a scary moment when i was doing the mold for machinable wax, I didn&rsquo;t want to take the risk with small part that needs specially made part to hold the object.</p>
                                         <p dir="ltr">It was better to cut with 170 feed rate and now I could make after-finish with sandpaper. Be careful not to breathe in the powder of wood so it's wise to wear some kind of mask to avoid powder. </p>
                                         <p dir="ltr">I've used (T-bone) which i thought is very stable to make tolerance between two parts. I've put 0.2 in both ends with the male-parts as my instructor guided me to make tolerance 0.2 for all different kinds of woods.</p>
                                         <p dir="ltr">However due to lack of experience i had sand-out the male or female part in final assembly I'm still managing to find out what cause the tolerance to be unsuitable for the press-fit. It takes more time make tolerance by sandpaper or with cutting the wood by machine.</p>

                                         <p dir="ltr"> The backboard is also sliding type as my intention is making the design that my circuit can be easily accessed when i want to, I have to make final arrangement but If the board is to be stuck at the side-part of my thing. I can easily remove the backboard and fix the circuit from behind not disassembling the whole parts which could be a disaster </p>
